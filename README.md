# Hubitat-TP-Link-Integration
TP-Link devices Hubitat Integration without a need for a Node Applet nor a Kasa Account (login).

# UPDATED DRIVERS AND APP TO VERSION 4.3.  DOCUMENTATION UPDATE IN-PROCESS.

# Update 4.2
Changes
1.  Application only does device search when run manually.  (Note:  If an IP address changes, the user runs the app to update.  To preclude this, set your IP addresses to STATIC in your wifi router.)

2.  Application automatically updates the device data for older versions, assuring upgrade is as smooth as possible.

3.  Bulbs now support capability "change level".  This allows pressing an up/down button then stopping to gradually change the bulb brightness.

4.  All devices added a user command to synchronize the Kasa App device name with the set Hubitat label.

5.  Cleaned up error messages for comms error with explicit recommendations to resolve.

# Description
A TP-Link integration without the need for a Node.js server nor the need for a Kasa Cloud login.  Uses UDP messaging on Hubitat, so the solution is cloudless and a single integration for all situations.
